    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, I will be examining data from two historical datasets about domestic fuel use in the United States. These cover the period 1960-1970, at the census tract level, and of course are not entirely complete. They are made available through the National Historical GIS, a project of IPUMS. For those who are unfamiliar, I highly suggest checking out the homepage of https://www.ipums.org/ and also https://www.nhgis.org/ , to read more. \n",
